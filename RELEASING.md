# Releasing `gh-actions-lock`

## Cutting a release

From a clean, current `main`, preview the next release:

```sh
RELEASE_DRY_RUN=1 script/release patch
```

Then cut it:

```sh
script/release patch
```

To preview a release candidate:

```sh
RELEASE_DRY_RUN=1 script/release patch --rc
```

Then cut it:

```sh
script/release patch --rc
```

The first candidate is `vX.Y.Z-rc.1`; repeating the same bump increments
`rc.N`. Run the bump without `--rc` to publish the stable `vX.Y.Z`.

Release tags are immutable. If publishing fails, fix the publisher and run
the release script again for the next RC.

Use `patch` for compatible fixes, `minor` for compatible additions, and `major`
for breaking changes.

The script validates the repository, checks the current branch and `origin/main`,
then pushes and verifies an annotated `vX.Y.Z` or `vX.Y.Z-rc.N` tag.

The tag workflow verifies the tag, then publishes the binaries, attestations,
and GitHub release.

## Dependabot compatibility

Before releasing, decide whether
[Dependabot's CLI integration](https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/blob/main/github_actions/lib/dependabot/github_actions/lockfile/cli_engine.rb)
must move with the release. Update `dependabot-core` when the release changes:

- CLI flags used by Dependabot.
- Findings JSON or exit codes.
- Relocking behavior.
- The lockfile schema.

Dependabot
[pins the CLI version and binary checksums](https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/blob/main/github_actions/Dockerfile)
and currently
[accepts only lockfile schema `v0.0.2`](https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/blob/main/github_actions/lib/dependabot/github_actions/constants.rb).
Add schema support there before this CLI emits a new version. Unrelated releases
do not need a Dependabot bump.
